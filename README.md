# Romulus - Space apps 2018 Waterloo ON
##Challenge Description
We proposed our own problem combining CSA's challenge in finding Near Earth Objects
from Canada's very own satellite, NEOSSAT. Additionally, we took the concepts from
 NASA's Moon rover mission challenge to plan rover/probe missions to NEO's given their trajectory.
